## Hi there 👋

This is a funny little project to see how many people can we get in one github organization! [Joining is really easy.](https://github.com/3v3ry0n3/request-to-join) When you are invited please make sure your [membership is public](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership)!

## Some rules
- Please don't delete other people's work or make big changes. If you are unsure, make a issue and @mention the user.
- It _would be nice_ if you would not spam empty repos. They make it hard to find anything!
- Currently not officially a rule: No NSWF, everything has to be SWF.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
