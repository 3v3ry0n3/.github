## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a funny little project to see how many people can we get in one github organization! 

> **Note**
> [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) at the time of typing has 4.4k public members.
> Can we beat that???

### How to join?
[Joining is really easy (instructions here).](https://github.com/3v3ry0n3/request-to-join#readme)
When you are invited please make sure your [membership is public](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership)!

## Some rules
- Please don't delete other people's work or make big changes. If you are unsure, make a issue and @mention the user.
- It _would be nice_ if you would not spam empty repos. They make it hard to find anything!
- Currently not officially a rule: No NSWF, everything has to be SWF.
